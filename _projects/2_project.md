### Introduction 
In manufacturing quality control, manual defect inspection becomes impractical at scale. While computer vision techniques like semantic segmentation and object detection [1] have revolutionized automated inspection, they face a significant challenge: new product lines lack the extensive labeled training data needed for these models. This data scarcity can compromise quality control effectiveness for novel products.

### Project Objectives & Role
In this internship project, I led the evaluation of unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for manufacturing quality control. The key objectives were:
1. Evaluate and compare ten different anomaly detection models, focusing on:
   - Processing capability for non-square images
   - Heat map generation quality
   - Model size and inference speed
   - Detection accuracy (recall)
2. Identify the most effective model for production deployment

### Methods
We evaluated ten different anomaly detection models, focusing on their ability to process non-square images and produce meaningful heat maps. The models were trained on defect-free (OK) samples and tested on defective (NG) samples.

### Results 
Three models emerged as top performers:

EfficientAd [2] demonstrated superior performance with:
- Most accurate heat map generation
- Smallest model size (30 MB)
- Highest recall score (0.55607)
- Effective localization of anomalous regions

### Discussion
The unsupervised models serve multiple purposes:
- Generate annotation data for supervised models
- Assist in data quality inspection
- Identify anomaly signals including:
  - Defects
  - Lighting variations
  - Layout differences
- Flag potentially defective samples without pre-existing annotations
- **Social Value:** By improving defect detection, we enhance product quality and safety, ultimately benefiting consumers and manufacturers.
